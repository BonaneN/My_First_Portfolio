# üìÅMy_First_Portfolio

This repository contains my first steps in building structured and semantic web pages using HTML5. The project covers a progression from basic page creation to a complete personal portfolio.

## üß† Project Overview

The My_First_Portfolio project is split into two parts:

html_basic/: A series of learning exercises focused on HTML structure, layout consistency, embedded content, and basic creativity.

portfolio/: A fully semantic and organized personal portfolio page built from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information.

### Skills & Concepts Gained

- HTML5 Best Practices: Proper use of semantic tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.
- Page Structure & Validation: Learned the importance of clean, valid HTML and how to test using the W3C Validator.
- Navigation & Layout Consistency: Developed a consistent structure across multiple pages for better user experience and maintainability.
- Embedding External Content: Practiced embedding tweets and linking multimedia content.
- Creativity with Tables: Used basic HTML tables to organize and present data cleanly.
- Portfolio Design: Built a personal portfolio page showcasing projects, bio, and contact information using semantic and accessible markup.
